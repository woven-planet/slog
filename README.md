CI automatically uploads a zip-archive to https://artifactory.pdx.l5.woven-planet.tech/repository/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/mothership/slog/. This .zip archive could be imported into another bazel project, e.g. using the following URL: `https://artifactory.pdx.l5.woven-planet.tech/repository/mothership/slog/slog-v0.2.27.zip`.  The .zip file naming and content are matching a .zip file that could be created via GitHub releases at https://github.tri-ad.tech/level5/slog/releases.
