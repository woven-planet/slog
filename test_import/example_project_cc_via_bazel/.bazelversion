5.4.0
# NOTE: next version 6.0.0 was causing build failure due to using googletest
# 1.10, it was transitively using bazel_tools platform in the old way and
# starting from 6.0.0 it isn't supported. To upgrade bazel we would need to
# upgrade dependencies.
# TODO(vsbus): update this test as improt via bazel5. Add a newer test with Bzlmod in bazel8.
